# Client/Server Communication
- SOAP, REST, GraphQL
- SSE, WebSockets
- Raw TCP

Problem
- Any communication protocol needs client library for the language of choice
 - SOAP Library
 - HTTP Client Library

- Hard to maintain and patch client libraries
 - HTTP/1.1 HTTP/2, new features, security etc.

gRPC
- Client Library : One library for popular languages
- Protocol : HTTP/2 (hidden implementation)
- Message Format : Protocol buffers as format

# gRPC modes
- Unary RPC
- Server streaming RPC
- Client streaming RPC
- Bidirectional streaming RPC

# Todo application (server, client) with gRPC
- createTodo()
- readTodos() //synchronous
- readTodos() //server stream

# gRPC pros & Cons
## Pros
- Fast & Compact
- One Client Library
- Progress Feedback (upload)

- H2/Protobuf
## Cons
- Schema
- Thick Client
- Proxies
- Still young (support)
- Error handling
- No native browser support
