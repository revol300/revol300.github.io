# Introduction
Q. Waht is a web application?
A. A web (based) application is any program that is accessed over a network connection using HTTP, rather than existing within a device's memory.

making web apps
1. Build your App
2. Pack it for shipping
3. Host or Run the App

we are going to using a nginx.

# Web-apps Problem
Way too many of them and still growing
"But it worked on my machine!" issues
Faster Updates due to growth of DevOps
Abundance of Data
Wide use VMs

# Container
Containers are an abstraction at the Application layer that packages codes and dependencies together

hypervisor , docker host os picture~~~

Containers ...
Consumes less storage and memeory
Easier and faster to ship
If they work on one machine; they work on all machines
Cost efficient and easy to sacle
Possible to eliminate data loss and downtime

# Introducing Docker
Docker is an open platform for developers and system admins to build, ship and run containerized applications.

- Most widely used Containerization platform
- Huge comments:munity support
- Large amount of 3rd party application support
- Works on Windows and Mac too

Dockerfile(build) => DockerImage(ship) => containers(Run)

#Docker Architecture
Docker Client = > interaction with client
Docker CLI ex.) docker run, docker pull
Docker API ex.) client.container.run, client.container.pull

Docker Host => actually performing part

Docker Registry => store docker images 

Docker Client         Docker Host        Docker Registry
         API calls, Result         Images

#Dockerfile
A sequential set of instruction for Docker Engine
Primary way of interacting with Docker
Order of sequence is important!
Each instruction creates a layer
Layers can be cached and reused by Docker

##Docker file structure
### Fundamental Instruction

```
ARG CODE_VERSION=16.04

FROM ubuntu:${CODE_VERSION}

RUN apt-get update -y

CMD ["bash"]
```

### Configuration Instruction

```
FROM ubuntu:16.04

LABEL Creator: "Cerulean Canvas"

RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y curl \
    && apt-get clean \
    && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

RUN mkdir /home/Codes

ENV USER Cerulean-Canvas
ENV SHELL /bin/bash
ENV LOGNAME Cerulean-Canvas

CMD ["bash"]
```

### Expose Instruction

```
FROM ubuntu:16.04

RUN apt-get update && apt-get install nginx -y \
    && apt-get clean \
    && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

EXPOSE 80

CMD ["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"]

```

# Docker Images
A stack of multiple layers created from Dockerfile Instructions
Each layer apart from the top one is R/O
The top player is R/W type
Recognized by name order Image ID
They are pushed to and can be pulled from Docker Hub

```
docker image inspect img_from
```
를 통해 image 파일의 설정값을 볼 수 있다.


# Container

Running instance of a Docker ImageProvides similar isolation to VMs but lighter ... A LOT LIGHTER!
Adds writable layer on top of image layers and works on it
Can talk to other containers like processes instructions Linux
Uses Copy-on-Write

# Docker Netweork Driver
Piece of software that enables networking of containers
Responsible for invoking a network inside the host or within the cluster
Native n/w drivers are shipped with Docker Engine
Remote n/w drivers are created and managed by 3rd party vendors or community
IP Address Management Drivers provide default subnets if not specified by admin

Docker's Native Network Driver
Overlay Network => Swarm Mode of docker multi host multi container

docker network create --driver bridge my-bridge
docker network create --driver bridge --subnet=192.168.0.0/16 --ip-range=192.168.5.0/24 my-bridge-1
docker network ls --filter driver=bridge

# Docker Storage
Docker Volume : dedicated directoreis on host's file system
tmpfs : not persistent volume
volume : /var/lib/docker/volume/ 의 특정 위치에 저장 non docker 프로세스는 건드릴 수 없다
bind mount : bind mount는 Data가 Host System의 어디에든지 저장이 가능

# Docker Compose
Multi container applicatio with single file

``` YAML
version: '3.3'
services:
   db:
     image: mysql:5.7
     container_name: mysql_database
     volumes:
       - db_data:/var/lib/mysql
     restart: always
     environment:
       MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: word@press
       MYSQL_DATABASE: wordpress
       MYSQL_USER: wordpress
       MYSQL_PASSWORD: abc@123

   wordpress:
     depends_on:
       - db
     image: wordpress:latest
     container_name: wd_frontend
     volumes:
       - wordpress_files:/var/www/html
     ports:
       - "8000:80"
     restart: always
     environment:
       WORDPRESS_DB_HOST: db:3306
       WORDPRESS_DB_USER: wordpress
       WORDPRESS_DB_PASSWORD: abc@123
volumes:
    wordpress_files:
    db_data:
```

## Docker compose command line
docker-compose config --services
docker-compose images
docker-compose ps
docker-compose top
docker-compose down
docker-compose up

# Docker Swarm
A Container Orchestrator is a tool used to provision, schedule and manage containers at large scale over one or more clusters of multiple hosts
manager host + worder hosts

To make sure that the Swarm cluster functions properly, at least more than half of the nodes should be working.
use docker-machine
# Docker  GUIL
